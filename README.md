## Introduction

**What**

This is a web page image scraping tool built in node.js

**Why**

I was looking for something to pull a whole bunch of thumbnails of my favorite illustrator [David Downton](http://www.daviddownton.com/latest-news.html) so I can save it as reference for learning how to draw fashion illustrations. 


## Usage

1. Clone repo and `npm install`
2. Set up `config` variables in object in the `app.coffee` file
3. Run:

```
$ coffee app.coffee
```
